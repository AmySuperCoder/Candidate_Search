# Candidate Search

This app allows users to go through a list of potential candidates and save or reject them. Saved candidates are available to view in a grid format, and users can reject candidates from that grid.

## Installation

To install, copy files from this GitHub repository: https://github.com/AmySuperCoder/Candidate_Search.

## Usage

To install, type nmp i to install the dependencies, and then type npm run dev to get a link to open the server.

When the browser is opened, the user will see a potential job candidate.

![Initial screen example](./Images/Candidate_search_example.png)

Click the plus icon to save the candidate for further consideration, or click the minus button to reject the candidate. The app will display the next candidate.

Some of the candidates available to view do not have any saved information, such as a username or email. When that happens, you will see this error:

![Candidate error](.\Images\Candidate_error.png)

When that happens, simply click the Next Candidate button.

Candidates are given in batches of 30. When you have looked at all 30 candidates, you will see the following message:

![No more candidates](.\Images\Candidate_error.png)

If you would like to view more candidates, click refresh on your internet browser.

To see the candidates you have saved, click Potential Candidates on the navigation bar at the top of the screen. Then you will see a grid with the candidates you have saved.

If you would like to eliminate a candidate from that list, click the reject icon next to that candidate. 

To sort the names of the saved candidates alphabetically, click Sort names A-Z. To only view candidates who have supplied a bio, click Filter candidates with bios.

If you do not have any saved candidates, you will see a message indicating that at the bottom of the screen.
